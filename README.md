### Auto hot key script
##### Download and first install autohotkey version 2
```please download the original auto hot key v2 from the official source```
. Run this script `clip.ahk` (Or you may put it in your startup folder) .
Normal multi-line paste does not work anymore `(when stealth paste is enabled)
it only copies first line`
